Future Directions
- Web scrapper to collect positive and negatives examples for a given species
- Choose the size as well 


1. Parse the positive examples from JASPAR as PFMs
    - Convert to PWM
    - Make sure it includes the 6 highest frequency columns sequentially
    - Put into list
2. Parse in negative examples from HOMER?
    - Review HOMER method
    - Figure out which background sequence
    - Make sure it includes the 6 highest frequency columns sequentially
    - Figure out how to make a PWM from sequences
3. Develop and Feed in the positive and negatives examples
    - Figure out which parameters and what the input and output should be
    - Fine tuning
